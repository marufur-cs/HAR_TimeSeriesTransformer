# Human Activity Classification Using Time Series Transformes

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in preventive healthcare, assisted living, fall prevention, and real-time monitoring of older adults. Using the HAR70+ dataset—which contains dual-sensor accelerometer recordings from elderly individuals, including those who use walking aids—this study compares three advanced sequence modeling architectures: Mamba, iTransformer, and PatchTST.
